## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### 🔍 Requirements

Before installing, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- **Python 3**
- **Pip**
- **Virtual Environment (venv)**
- **PyInstaller**
- **PyQt6** (for GUI rendering)

If missing, the script will prompt you to install them.

---

### 📦 Installation (Automatic)

To get started, simply run the **build script**:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The script provides two options:

1️⃣ **Dry Run**: Checks if all requirements are met, but does not install anything.\
2️⃣ **Direct Install & Build**: Installs missing dependencies and compiles the application.

---

### 🖥️ Running the Application

Once built, run the executable from the **Build** directory:

```bash
./CommandManager
```

If running from source, activate the virtual environment and execute:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```
